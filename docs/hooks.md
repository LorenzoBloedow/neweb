# What are Hooks?

Hooks are a new planned feature that will allow developers to extend the functionality of neweb components  
by hooking into key lifecycle moments of a component, similar to [webpack hooks](https://webpack.js.org/api/compiler-hooks/)

For example, you could execute a function at the exact moment neweb receives a screenshot in the [Link](/react/Link) component

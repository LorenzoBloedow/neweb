# What are Flavors?

Flavors are a new planned feature that will allow developers to **fully**  
customize the appearance of neweb components and, if they want, distribute it as a package  
for other developers to adopt their design

## How will they work?

To create a flavor you'll simply pass a function to the `flavor` prop of any component  
and the entire state and classes of the component will be passed to you by neweb so you can fully  
customize it and even react to state changes!  
There are even plans for a marketplace where you can sell your flavors to other developers!

# The scope of neweb

It's important for a project to have scope, this holds especially true for neweb since we want to bring as much innovation as possible in the component library sphere and we can't achieve that
if we don't hyper-focus on the visual and behavioral elements of components.

## Out of scope

The following is out of scope for neweb:

-   Research and implementation of technologies that haven't been adopted by any of the 4 major
    browsers yet (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox)

## Scope

The following topics are in scope for neweb and is what we're concerned with:

-   Making user's lives easier by bringing new ideas to web components
-   How users are responding to the changes brought by our components
-   Identifying common pain-points in the web that can be solved by components
-   Implementing already known and tested accessibility standards and researching new ways
    to make the web more accessible for everyone
-   Identifying pain-points and boilerplate in web development and finding ways to make
    web development easier and more enjoyable by addressing them
